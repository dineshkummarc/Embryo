        <h1>Embryo</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These are a standard set of files, scripts, stylesheets, folder structures that I use whenever I start a new web project. Below I discuss the different aspects of it.</p>

<h2>Google Pagespeed Module</h2>

<p>On our Apache server we have the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/">Google Pagespeed Module</a> installed so there are certain things that we don't do which we used to. Things like <em>combining multiple stylesheets into one</em> we don't do any more because the module handles that, and caches the combined files.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>The CSS is 'object-orientated' (OOCSS) as I feel that is the most scalable way to handle projects of any size.</p>

<p>I disagree with the seemingly common tradition of using a CSS reset (mainly because nearly all of them take a 'scored earth policy' approach). So instead I chose to use something similar but not quite a 'reset': <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css">normalise.css</a> which normalises style settings across all browsers (and also fixes some rendering bugs). But what makes normalise so good is that it leaves a lot of the default browser settings in place, because they realise that you end up writing more CSS to work-around the reset than you would have written to work-around the browser defaults! I only had a couple of my own customisations (personal preferences such as the amount of line-height spacing) otherwise the rest of it was fine for me to incorporate into my projects.</p>

<h2>Sass</h2>

<p>I've started utilising <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> - being someone who hated the idea of pre-processors (and complained about their failings and how writing OOCSS could resolve a lot of those issues) I appreciate there are some things they do very well that can't be replicated. Plus, knowing all their failings you are better equipped to avoid them when using a pre-processor (if you don't understand the issues with using a pre-processor then I advise you to read my post about <a href="https://github.com/Integralist/Blog-Posts/blob/master/Guide-to-using-SASS.md">using Sass</a> OR to not use a pre-processor).</p>

<h2>Browser inconsistencies</h2>

<p>We all know that browsers render both CSS and JavaScript differently depending on their engine. In CSS the way I manage this is by writing my CSS as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write CSS so it works with Firefox</li>
<li>Use <code>IE Conditional Comments</code> to target IE issues**</li>
<li>Use <code>@media</code> hack to target WebKit browsers++</li>
</ul><p>**<em>I appreciate that IE10 no longer supports conditional comments but IE10's CSS engine should hopefully by then just work!</em></p>

<p><em>++It's very rare I have to target a WebKit browser, but once in a blue moon there is a difference in design that I just can't ignore</em></p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>I write all my JavaScript to be compatible with the <code>AMD</code> module format.</p>

<p>There are a couple of scripts I rarely use nowadays, these being: jQuery (+ two plugins) &amp; SWFObject, but I've included them anyway.</p>

<p>Here is a round-up of some of the scripts and 'modules' used in this project template:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/">HTML5Shim</a> - 
"IE Print Protector helps IE render HTML5 elements correctly, both on screen and in print."</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.requirejs.org/">RequireJs</a> - 
"RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined modules"</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/">Hogan.js</a> - 
"JavaScript templating from twitter (Mustache compatible)"</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/briancavalier/when.js#readme">When</a> - 
"A lightweight CommonJS Promises/A and when() implementation. It also provides several other useful Promise-related concepts, such as joining and chaining, and has a robust unit test suite."</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ded/morpheus#readme">Morpheus</a> - 
"A Brilliant Animator. Morpheus lets you "tween anything" in parallel on multiple elements"</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/pubsubz#readme">PubSubz</a> - 
"Just another compact library-agnostic Pub/Sub implementation."</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine BDD</a> - 
"Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing your JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests."</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://sinonjs.org/">SinonJs</a> - "Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript. No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework"</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> - 
"Google Analytics is the enterprise-class web analytics solution that gives you rich insights into your website traffic and marketing effectiveness"</p></li>
<li>
<p>The following are a list of AMD based modules that I use a lot:</p>

<ul>
<li>Array utilities (taken from <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/amd-utils">millermedeiros</a>)</li>
<li>Checks (such as <code>isDefined</code> and <code>isIE</code>)</li>
<li>CSS utilities</li>
<li>DOM utilities</li>
<li>Element utilities</li>
<li>Events library (modified from Thomas 'PointedEars' Lahn)</li>
<li>Host utilities</li>
<li>Pattern utilities (such as Dictionary, Observer, Promises)</li>
<li>Polyfills</li>
<li>String utilities</li>
<li>XHR abstraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>RequireJs Plugins</h2>

<p>There are a couple of RequireJs plugins we use:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/requirejs-plugins">async</a> - 
"Useful for JSONP and asynchronous dependencies (e.g. Google Maps)"</li>
</ul><h2>RequireJs Build Script</h2>

<p>I use a custom build script along with the RequireJs' <code>r.js</code> optimiser which minifies and concatenates all my scripts into a single file ready for production use.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> language for writing my documentation (and also my blog posts) and use Node to convert them into HTML files. </p>

<p>Miller Medeiros has created <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/gh-markdown-cli">GH Markdown CLI</a> which combines specific Node packages into a program which automates this process using a simple command via the terminal. I've also taken the design from GitHub's CSS to give my documentation a 'cleaner' look and feel.</p>

<p>Have a read through the <a href="https://github.com/Integralist/Project-Template-Files/blob/master/Assets/Documentation/Command.txt">Command.txt</a> file to see an example of how you could use it yourself.</p>

<h2>JS Hint</h2>

<p>I run my JavaScript through a lint program called <a href="http://www.jshint.org/">JS Hint</a>, but rather than manually process my scripts by hand (e.g. copy/paste each script into the website interface, see errors, fix them, copy/paste updated code to check errors are definitely fixed, rinse &amp; repeat for each script file…) I use a Node package which helps automate this and makes testing my scripts for syntax errors a lot easier.</p>

<h2>CSS Lint</h2>

<p>I run my CSS through a lint program called <a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a>, but rather than manually process my stylesheets by hand (e.g. copy/paste each stylesheet into the website interface, see errors, fix them, copy/paste updated code to check errors are definitely fixed, rinse &amp; repeat for each stylesheet…) I use a Node package which helps automate this and makes testing my stylesheet for syntax errors a lot easier.</p>
