Project Template
================================

Description
-----------

These are a standard set of files, scripts, stylesheets, folder structures that I use whenever I start a new web project.

Well... I don't use jQuery or any of it's plugins (my team are more reliant on jQuery for helping them with JavaScript, but I prefer to go 'plain vanilla' style).

Google Pagespeed Module
-----------------------

On our Apache server we have the [Google Pagespeed Module](http://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/) installed so there are certain things that we don't do which we used to. Things like combining multiple stylesheets into one we don't do any more because the module handles that, and caches the combined files.

JavaScript Libraries
--------------------

There are a few different JavaScript libraries we use:

* [HTML5Shim](http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/) - 
"IE Print Protector helps IE render HTML5 elements correctly, both on screen and in print."

* [LABjs](http://labjs.com/) - 
"The core purpose of LABjs (Loading And Blocking JavaScript) is to be an all-purpose, on-demand JavaScript loader, capable of loading any JavaScript resource, from any location, into any page, at any time"

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - 
"jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development"

* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - 
"jQuery UI provides abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library"

* [jCarouselLite](http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/) - 
"jCarousel Lite is a jQuery plugin that carries you on a carousel ride filled with images and HTML content"
- I've modified this script so it can move forwards as well as backwards + made it validate.

* [Uploadify](http://www.uploadify.com/) - 
"Uploadify is a jQuery plugin that integrates a fully-customizable multiple file upload utility on your website"

* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) - 
"Google Analytics is the enterprise-class web analytics solution that gives you rich insights into your website traffic and marketing effectiveness"
